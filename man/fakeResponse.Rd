\title{Return something that looks enough like an httr 'response'}
\usage{
fakeResponse(url = "", verb = "GET", status_code = 200,
  headers = list(), content = NULL)

fakeGET(url, query = NULL, ...)

fakePUT(url, body = NULL, ...)

fakePATCH(url, body = NULL, ...)

fakePOST(url, body = NULL, ...)

fakeDELETE(url, body = NULL, ...)

fakeDownload(url, destfile, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A character URL for the request. For \code{fakeDownload}, this
should be a path to a file that exists.}

\item{verb}{Character name for the HTTP verb. Default is "GET"}

\item{status_code}{Integer HTTP response status}

\item{headers}{Optional list of additional response headers to return}

\item{content}{If supplied, a JSON-serializable list that will be returned
as response content with Content-Type: application/json. If no \code{content}
is provided, and if the \code{status_code} is not 204 No Content, the
\code{url} will be set as the response content with Content-Type: text/plain.}

\item{query}{For \code{fakeGET}, optional query parameters in the request, as
a list (as \code{GET} expects). If supplied, the \code{query} will be set
as the fake \code{content}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the real functions, ignored by the mocks.}

\item{body}{For the other fake verbs, a request payload. If provided, it will
be set as the response \code{content}.}

\item{destfile}{For \code{fakeDownload}, character file path to "download"
to. \code{fakeDownload} will copy the file at \code{url} to this path.}
}
\value{
The fake verbs return a 'httr' response class object.
\code{fakeDownload} returns 0, the success code returned by
\code{\link[utils]{download.file}}.
}
\description{
These functions allow mocking of HTTP requests without requiring an internet
connection or server to run against. Their return shape is a 'httr'
"response" class object that should behave like a real response generated
by a real request.
}
\details{
These mock functions can be used to replace the 'httr' verb functions using
the 'testthat' package's \code{\link[testthat]{with_mock}} function. See the
test suite for this package for an illustration of how to use them.
